# Login-Page
a login page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

![Login Page Image] (Login-Page/image.png)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The page contains a login button but it will not submit input data necessarily. 
The username and password are not sent to a backend or server to be validated.
When the user clicks the login button, the Javascript code validates that
the "username" inputted is "user" and the password is "webDev1234".
If they both match, then an alert dialog is displayed and the page reloads.
Otherwise, an error message is displayed.
